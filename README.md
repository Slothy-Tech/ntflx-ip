<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Netflix doesn’t issue personal account bans often, but it does block IP ranges — especially ones used by VPNs, proxies, or datacenter connections.</li>
    <li>If you’re getting proxy/VPN errors or unable to access content, your IP may be banned or throttled.</li>
    <li>This guide helps you change your IP, clear tracking data, and use a fresh connection to access Netflix again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass Netflix IP Bans</h2>
<p>Follow each step carefully. Skipping parts may result in the same error messages or streaming blocks returning right away.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>This is the most important step. Netflix blocks many IPs tied to free VPNs, shared proxies, and suspicious activity.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a Paid VPN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a VPN known to work with Netflix — providers with rotating residential IPs have the best results.</li>
            <li>Connect to a clean server (usually labeled as “Streaming” or “Netflix US/UK” in your VPN app).</li>
            <li>Verify your IP has changed using <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com" target="_blank">whatismyipaddress.com</a> before opening Netflix.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switching Networks:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use mobile data instead of Wi-Fi or connect to a different network entirely to get a new IP address.</li>
            <li>If you're on a dynamic IP, restarting your modem may assign you a new one from your ISP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Free VPNs are almost always blocked. You need a service with clean, non-flagged IPs.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing App or Browser Data</h3>
<p>Netflix may cache old IP session data or cookies. If you previously connected with a banned IP, this can trigger errors even after switching to a good one.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>On Mobile (Android/iOS):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall the Netflix app to wipe stored data. Reinstall it only after changing your IP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>On PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your browser settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data.</li>
            <li>Clear cookies and cached images/files — especially for <code>netflix.com</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always clear data before logging into your Netflix account again, or you may re-trigger the block.</p>

<h3>3. Reinstalling Netflix or Using a Clean Browser</h3>
<p>This step ensures you’re launching the app or site with a clean slate, free of residual traces that could re-identify your connection.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>On Mobile:</strong> Reinstall the Netflix app after changing your IP and clearing all old data.</li>
    <li><strong>On PC:</strong> Use an incognito window or a browser you haven’t used with Netflix recently.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Logging In Carefully</h3>
<p>Logging into a banned or previously flagged Netflix account might get your new IP flagged too — be cautious here.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If possible, wait 24 hours before logging in after changing your setup.</li>
    <li>Don’t log in from multiple devices on the same account right away, especially from different IPs or countries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1 (IP Change):</strong> Gives you a clean network identity that isn’t blocked.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 (Data Clearing):</strong> Removes cookies and identifiers tied to the previous banned session.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 (Reinstall or Incognito):</strong> Prevents old app/browser traces from interfering with your new IP.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 (Login Caution):</strong> Ensures your account doesn’t get flagged again right after recovering access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing all four steps ensures your connection looks brand new to Netflix’s systems.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Stick to major VPNs that update IP pools regularly and specifically support Netflix (e.g., NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark).</li>
    <li>Keep your VPN location consistent — rapid switching between countries can trigger blocks.</li>
    <li>If access breaks again later, repeat the same steps with a new IP.</li>
    <li>Make sure DNS leaks are blocked — use your VPN’s built-in leak protection.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method gets you back into Netflix with a clean connection and avoids the proxy/VPN ban screen. Stay consistent and avoid sketchy tools that trigger automated blocks.</p>
